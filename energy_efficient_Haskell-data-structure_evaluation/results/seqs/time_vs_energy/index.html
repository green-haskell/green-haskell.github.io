<title>Green Haskell: Towards Energy-Efficient Programming in Haskell</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">

# Helping developers write energy efficient Haskell through a data-structure evaluation

## Time vs PKG Energy and DRAM Energy (client platform)

### Sequences

Below you can find the graphics generated from the raw results for this study, for the Sequence abstraction.
<br />
For each operation of the benchmark we present a graphic with the absolute values obtained for Execution Time, Package Energy and DRAM Energy (and the energy total). We also present a graphic that represents the relative values for each implementation (relative to the maximum observed for the operation).

**addAll** operation:
