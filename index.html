<title>Green Haskell: Towards Energy-Efficient Programming in Haskell</title>

# We are updating the site! Please bear with us!


The energy consumption of electronic devices has become a critical factor over the last decade.
<br />
Studies have shown that, in 2012, the information and communication technologies (ICT) devices were responsable for almost 5% of the world's energy consumption.
With the proliferation of devices in operation that ratio is increasing.
<br />
Also with the advent of battery powered devices there is an aim to make them run for longer periods of time between recharges.
<br />
Energy-efficiency has therefore become a pressing concern for hardware and software engineers.

This site, and studies contained herein, were born out of the necessity to study the energy consumption that may be attributed to the software components running on the hardware (a.k.a. **software driven energy consumption**).
In fact, it has been proposed that software optimizations alone may be able to provide energy savings from 30% to 90%.

In our work we focus on the **Haskell** programming language and libraries.
<br />
Haskell is a lazy purely functional language.
In particular, Haskell has mature implementations of sophisticated features such as laziness, partial function application, software transactional memory, tail recursion, and a kind system. Furthermore, recursion is the norm in Haskell programs and side effects are restricted by the type system of the language.
These characteristics make it significantly different from mainstream programming languages. 
<br />
But functional languages and features are increasing in popularity. Huge corporations with concerns for energy consumption, such as Facebook, use Haskell for efficient parallel data access on their servers. Also, mainstream programming languages like Java and C# have adopted some functional programming features.

Below you can find a list of the studies conducted/papers produced on the topic proposed.
<br />
On each paper&apos;s page you will find pointers to all the benchmarks and tools code, and the results obtained.
