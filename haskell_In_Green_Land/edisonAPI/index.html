## Analyzing the Energy Behavior of a Purely Functional Language


### Edison API

Below is a summary of the Edison API, for its various Abstractions. If you are interested in the full details head over to the hackage page, [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/EdisonAPI "Edison API."). (The underline in a few function names is meant to mark functions for which both a lazy, and a strict version exists.)

  - Edison functions defined for Heaps and Sets

      * Constructors: empty, singleton, fromSeq, insert, insertSeq, union, unionSeq, unsafeInsertMin, unsafeInsertMax, unsafeFromOrdSeq, unsafeAppend

      * Destructors: minView, minElem, maxView, maxElem 

      * Deletions: delete, deleteAll, deleteSeq, deleteMin, deleteMax 

      * Observers: null, size, member, count, lookup, lookupM, lookupAll, lookupWithDefault, toSeq, toOrdSeq 

      * Filters and partitions: filterLT, filterLE, filterGT, filterGE, partitionLT_GE, partitionLE_GT, partitionLT_GT, filter, partition 

      * Folds: <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">fold</span> <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">fold1</span> <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">foldr</span> <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">foldl</span> <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">foldr1</span> <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">foldl1</span>


  - Edison functions which are specific to Sets:

      * Set operations: intersection, difference, symmetricDifference, properSubset, subset, intersectionWith 


  - Funtions defined for Associative Collections.

      * Constructors: empty, singleton, insert, insertSeq, union, unionSeq, fromSeq, unsafeInsertMin, unsafeInsertMax, unsafeFromOrdSeq, unsafeAppend, insertWith, insertWithKey, insertSeqWith, insertSeqWithKey, unionl, unionr, unionWith, unionSeqWith, fromSeqWith, fromSeqWithKey, unionWithKey, unionSeqWithKey

      * Destructors: minView, minElem, maxView, maxElem, minViewWithKey, minElemWithKey, maxViewWithKey, maxElemWithKey

      * Deletions: delete, deleteAll, deleteSeq, deleteMin, deleteMax

      * Observers: null, size, member, count, lookup, lookupM, lookupAll, lookupWithDefault, elements, toSeq, keys, toOrdSeq

      * Modifiers: adjust, adjustAll

      * Maps and folds: map, fold, fold1, foldr, foldl, foldr1, foldl1, mapWithKey, foldWithKey, foldrWithKey, foldlWithKey 

      * Filters and partitions: filter, partition, filterLT, filterLE, filterGT, filterGE, partitionLT_GE, partitionLE_GT, partitionLT_GT, filterWithKey, partitionWithKey 

      * Set-like operations: intersectionWith, difference, subset, intersectionWithKey
